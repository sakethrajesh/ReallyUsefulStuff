# Problem
[22. Generate Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/generate-parentheses/)

# Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def generateParenthesis(self, n: int) -> List[str]:
        res = []

        def f(p_open, p_closed, stack):
            if p_open == n == p_closed:
                res.append("".join(stack))
                return 

            if p_open < n:
                stack.append("(")
                f(p_open+1, p_closed, stack)
                stack.pop()

            if p_open > p_closed:
                stack.append(")")
                f(p_open, p_closed+1, stack)
                stack.pop()

        f(0, 0, [])

        return res
```
## Key Details
### Approach details
- Key idea to notice here is that this is a backtracking problem where the two paths we can split and choose between is adding a open or closed bracket
	- our base/end case would be when we have used all `n` open parentheses and `n` closed parentheses
### Implementation Details
1. This is a backtracking problem
	1. requires recursion
		1. When adding and altering a variable in a recursion problem that is passed around, must undo the change the case made before evaluating the next case
			```python
			if p_open < n:
				stack.append("(")
				f(p_open+1, p_closed, stack)
				stack.pop()
```

	 2. when collecting the base/ending cases of a recursive algorithm, have a global variable and append to it as this base/end case is hit
	    ```python
	    res = []
	    ...
		if p_open == n == p_closed:
			res.append("".join(stack))
			return 
```
