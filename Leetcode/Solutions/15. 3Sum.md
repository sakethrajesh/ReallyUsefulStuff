# Question
[15. 3Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/)
# Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def threeSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        nums.sort()
        print(nums)
        sol = []


        for i, n in enumerate(nums):
            target = -n
            s = set()

            if i > 0 and n == nums[i-1]:
                continue

            j = i+1
            while j < len(nums):
                p = nums[j]
                if target - p in s:
                    sol.append([n, p, target-p])
                    s.add(p)
                    
                    j += 1
                    while j < len(nums) and nums[j] == p:
                        j += 1   

                else:
                    s.add(p)
                    j += 1
        
        return sol
```
## Key Details
- big part of this question is not having repeating `3sums` 
- to do this, we sort the input array, so that same numbers are together; when iterating through the array, we skip if the current val is same as previous
