# Question
[39. Combination Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum/)
# Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def combinationSum(self, candidates: List[int], target: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        
        # dfs algo to traverse a binrary three with two options:
        # add the current option
        # do not add the current option and go ot next

        ret = []

        def dfs(i, s, c):
            # base case 1: sum reached
            if s == target:
                ret.append(c.copy())
                return

            # base case 2: exceeded sum
            if s > target:
                return
            
            # base case 3: ran out of canidates
            if i >= len(candidates):
                return
            
            # Two paths to explore
            # path 1: add current canidate
            c.append(candidates[i])
            dfs(i, s + candidates[i], c)

            # path 2: skip current canidate 
            c.pop()
            dfs(i+1, s, c)

        dfs(0, 0, [])
        return ret
```
## Key Details
### Approach Details
- classic backtracking problem
	- usually the idea is to either choose to add something or not and move to the next thing to decided if we should add that next thing or not
### Implementation Details
- need to append a copy of the array to the final `ret` array, otherwise it will append a empty array
- when working with recursion and editing a shared varible that is used agina in another recurions path (in this case `c`), make sure to reset that before using it agian
	```python
	# Two paths to explore
	# path 1: add current canidate
	c.append(candidates[i])
	dfs(i, s + candidates[i], c)

	# path 2: skip current canidate 
	c.pop()
	dfs(i+1, s, c)
```
